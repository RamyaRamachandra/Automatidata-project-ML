# Automatidata-project-ML

##### The Nuts and bolts of machine learning

You are a data professional in a data analytics firm called Automatidata. Their client, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (New York City TLC), was impressed with the work you have done and has requested that you build a machine learning model to predict if a customer will not leave a tip. They want to use the model in an app that will alert taxi drivers to customers who are unlikely to tip, since drivers depend on tips.

A notebook was structured and prepared to help you in this project. Please complete the following questions.

#### Course 6 End-of-course project: Build a machine learning model
In this activity, you will practice using tree-based modeling techniques to predict on a binary target class.


**The purpose** of this model is to find ways to generate more revenue for taxi cab drivers.

**The goal** of this model is to predict whether or not a customer is a generous tipper.


This activity has three parts:

**Part 1**: Ethical considerations

* Consider the ethical implications of the request

* Should the objective of the model be adjusted?

**Part 2**: Feature engineering

* Perform feature selection, extraction, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling
**Part 3**: Modeling

* Build the models, evaluate them, and advise on next steps
Follow the instructions and answer the questions below to complete the activity. Then, complete an Executive Summary using the questions listed on the PACE Strategy Document.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.
